## What is this?
*GitHub Integration* is a addon for Godot Engine that I've created mainly for a personal purpose.  
Pushing and Pulling repositories while I'm working on Godot (especially if I'm under a GameJam) could take some time and force me to save the project, open the brwoser/git bash/git gui, and do all the stuff.  
With this little addon which works directly in the editor, managing all your repositories will be very easy.  

## What can it do?
*Github Integration* offers the main functionalities provided by GitHub (and git itself), in a more accessible way.  
Currenlty, you can:
- Manage all of your public and private **repositories**, *including* the ones you share with organizations and the ones in which you are a collaborator (with proper permissions): create, delete, push and clone repositories within your Godot project
- Manage all of your public and private **gists**: delete, edit and create gists with a functional text editor
- Manage collaboration invitations, inviting user to your repositories or accept/decline invitations you have received

## How does it work?
I'm currently working on a [Wiki](https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.github-integration/wiki) for this plugin. It is a process that will take some time to complete since I want to provide a well-organized wiki with some basic explanations about GitHub itself. Anyway, I'm working on a user-friendly plugin, so everything should be the very ease to use for GitHub experienced users, and a little intuitive for people who never used GitHub or are not so experienced.
